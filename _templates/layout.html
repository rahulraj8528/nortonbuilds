    <h2>Guide to Install My Norton on This Device: Step-by-Step Setup Using Your Norton Product Key With Ease</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Norton Product Key</h3>
    <p>Before starting the installation, make sure you have the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A valid Norton product key (usually 25 characters)</li>
        <li>A Norton account (if you don’t have one, you’ll be prompted to create it)</li>
        <li>A stable internet connection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your product key can be found in your Norton retail card, confirmation email (if purchased online), or on the packaging.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Visit the Official Norton Setup Page</h3>
    <p>To begin the installation, go to either of the following websites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>www.norton.com/setup</strong></li>
        <li><strong>https www.norton.com setup</strong></li>
        <li><strong>my.norton.com home setup</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These official Norton URLs will redirect you to the Norton sign-in page. You’ll need to log in using your Norton account credentials.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sign In or Create a Norton Account</h3>
    <p>Once you're on the site:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on <strong>Sign In</strong></li>
        <li>Enter your email and password</li>
        <li>If you don't have an account, click <strong>Create Account</strong> and fill out the required details</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Having an account allows you to manage your Norton subscriptions and devices from one central dashboard.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Enter Your Norton Product Key</h3>
    <p>After signing in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look for the option to <strong>enter Norton product key</strong></li>
        <li>Input your 25-character product key exactly as it appears</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> or <strong>Next</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This step will link your product key to your Norton account, allowing you to proceed with the installation.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Download and Install Norton on Your Device</h3>
    <p>Once your product key is accepted:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on <strong>Download</strong> to start downloading the Norton installer</li>
        <li>Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions</li>
        <li>The installer will check for existing Norton versions, uninstall them if needed, and begin a fresh installation</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you're trying to <strong>install My Norton on this device</strong> after uninstalling it previously, this process acts as a <strong>Norton reinstall with product key</strong>.</p>

        <li>Open Norton</li>
        <li>Allow it to update virus definitions</li>
        <li>Run your first system scan to ensure your device is secure</li>
    </ul>
